This test includes making a graph network of water networks of Kinases and using various metrics to compare similarity.

1. All kinase waters were extracted via TS/JS and saved to ./allKinaseWaters.json
2. Python taking over because more features working with graphs



------ 
MMSEQ Clusters

Create database:
    mmseqs createdb all_kinases.fasta kinasesDB

Get TSV:
    mmseqs cluster kinasesDB clusters90 tmp --min-seq-id 0.9
    mmseqs createtsv kinasesDB kinasesDB clusters90 clusters90.tsv

Place TSV files into ./mmseq_clusters


---- 

Network Graphing with Seq Identity nonfunctional right now because
- PDBs can have multiple chains
